SparkleShare Version 0.0.11
===========================

SparkleShare is a file sharing and collaboration tool inspired by Dropbox. It 
allows you to instantly sync with any Git repository you have access to.

SparkleShare isn't just a piece of software, it's part of your workflow. It's 
designed to make sharing documents and collaboration easier, and to make peers 
aware of what you are doing. The user interface and features are made to 
support this goal. However, you may find SparkleShare useful for other kinds of 
purposes as well, like backing up files or monitoring your favourite project.
SparkleShare is not made to be a graphical frontend for git or a backup tool

In contrast to the projects name, we will very likely 
refuse to implement your personal ponies. :)

SparkleShare currently only works on Linux/GNOME.
Windows and OSX ports are planned for the future.
