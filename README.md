### Development

CmisSync re-uses a lot of source code from [SparkleShare](http://sparkleshare.org), an excellent Git sync tool. You might find references to SparkleShare in the source code. Please note that CmisSync is not SparkleShare and does not represent it. The build instructions of SparkleShare apply, though:
